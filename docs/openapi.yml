    This is a draft for solarisBank Digital Assets Platform API

    ## Authentication

    We require our partners to generate a pair of private & public keys.
    Partners MUST register the public key with the Platform and sign every request to our API
    using their private key.

    We are using *HTTP Signatures* IETF draft as the base for our authentication mechanism.
    As the digital signature algorithm in HTTP Signatures we are using *Ed25519*.

    Every HTTP request to the API MUST have following headers in addition to
    standard ones:

    * Digest
    * X-Nonce
    * Signature

    ### Digest Header

    The `Digest` header ensures integrity of the HTTP request body. It MUST be constructed
    following the HTTP Instance Digests RFC using SHA-256 algorithm.

    In case of GET request, the `Digest` header still must be constructed, assuming the request
    body is an empty string.

    See:

    * Instance Digests in HTTP <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3230>
    * Additional Hash Algorithms for HTTP Instance Digests <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5843>

    Example:
    ```
    Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=
    ```

    ### X-Nonce Header

    The `X-Nonce` header is supposed to uniquely identify the HTTP request
    and serves to protect against replay/playback attacks.
    The `X-Nonce` header value MUST be a string of up to 32 characters,
    which MUST be  unique across all the requests generated using the same
    API key.

    As an example, `X-Nonce` header value may be generated as 16-bytes
    random integer in hexadecimal representation.

    Example:
    ```
    X-Nonce: 514bdd41b15f6b1a0443f8c673adc9db
    ```

    ### Signature Header

    Signature Header string is used to provide authentication and integrity assurances
    without the need for shared secrets. It also does not require an additional round-trip
    in order to authenticate the client and allows the integrity of a message to be verified
    independently of the transport.

    Signature Parameters:

    * **keyId**

      Unique ID which is assigned to the Partner's API key.

    * **algorithm**

      The value for the `algorithm` parameter MUST be `"hs2019"`.

    * **created**

      The value of the `created` parameter MUST be the time at which
      the HTTP request was constructed as an integer Unix timestamp.

    * **headers**

      The `headers` parameter identifies how the canonical Signature String is constructed.
      Its value consists of a list of actual and pseudo- HTTP headers which will form
      the Signature String according to the HTTP Signatures draft v11.

      The `headers` parameter MUST include following
      headers: `(request-target)`, `(created)`, `digest`, `x-nonce`.

      The recommended value of the `headers` parameter is:
      `(request-target) (created) digest x-nonce`.

      See:

      * Signature String Construction
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-11#section-2.3>

      Example of Signature String for `headers="(request-target) (created) digest x-nonce"`:

      ```

      (request-target): get /foo?bar=123\n
      (created): 1557855475\n
      digest: SHA-256=47DEQpj8HBSa+/TImW+5JCeuQeRkm5NMpJWZG3hSuFU=\n
      x-nonce: 7c44d38b63f5e398af62d603b1155f5c

      ```

      Here `\n` indicate the ASCII newline character. Note the absence of it on the last line.

    * **signature**

      The value of the `signature` parameter is the digital signature of the HTTP request produced
      by the partner's private key.

      In order to create the `signature` parameter:

      * Construct the canonical Signature String according to the value of the `headers` parameter
      * Using the private key that corresponds to the provided `keyId` generate an Ed25519
        signature of the Signature String obtained on a previous step
      * Base64-encode the signature

    ### Examples

    ```
    POST /foo/bar
    Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=
    X-Nonce: 514bdd41b15f6b1a0443f8c673adc9db
    Signature: keyId="foobar",algorithm="hs2019",created=1557855475,headers="(request-target) (created) digest x-nonce",signature="IKGyxGiUFm3luudWGkTzf0TYQD2Fnkb6ed6BTfuXuDq/U9q6gQk6KxBSPx33ME1O2RLlH5HKG2WZnO8PgRGiDA=="

    {"hello": "world"}
    ```

    ```
    GET /foo?bar=123
    Digest: SHA-256=47DEQpj8HBSa+/TImW+5JCeuQeRkm5NMpJWZG3hSuFU=
    X-Nonce: 7c44d38b63f5e398af62d603b1155f5c
    Signature: keyId="foobar",algorithm="hs2019",created=1557855475,headers="(request-target) (created) digest x-nonce",signature="d0Wzjlpt2Y++DJtxKnD1ipkkwF5eU43jwtybqsy3tFqa5P3kYYIJa4TTQyMUZ62i58jwN7gK6q2MVJBDGQ6tDg=="
    ```

    See:

    * HTTP Signatures, <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-11>
    * Ed25519, <https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/>

        Approval Methods in `ACTIVATED` state can be used to

        There are different types of Approval Methods that can be used:

        * AUTHY_PUSH

        * DSA_ED25519

        Entities of type `PERSON` can use ApprovalMethods of type `AUTHY_PUSH`
        and `SMS`.
        Entities of type `PARTNER` can use ApprovalMethods of type `DSA_ED25519`.

      summary: Register a new Approval Method for this Entity
      description: |
        Registers a new Approval Method for an Entity with a given ID.

        There are different Approval Method types available:

        * AUTHY_PUSH -- Authy push notifications based MFA method,
          it can only be registered for Entities of type PERSON
        * DSA_ED25519 -- an ECDSA based MFA method,
          it can only be registered for Entities of type PARTNER

        There can be no more that one Approval Method of each type
        registered for one particular Entity.

        After being registered, the Approval Method is in `PENDING` state
        until it is activated by the platform operator, or by an external
        service, e.g. Authy.

        Approval Method in `ACTIVATED` state can be used to approve
        Transactions initiated by this Entity.

        To approve a Transaction, the Account holder (the Entity owning the Account)
        MUST provide a second factor approval before the Transaction is processed.

        The second factor approval depends on the ApprovalMethod and the type of
        the Transaction.

        The ApprovalMethod depends directly on the type of the Entity which
        owns the Transaction's Account:

        * for Entities of type PERSON  -- the approval method is either `AUTHY_PUSH` or `SMS`
        * for Entities of type PARTNER -- the approval method is `DSA_ED25519`

      summary: Create a Transfer
      description: |
        Issues a request to create a new Transfer
        from the given Account, owned by the given Entity, to another Account
        in the same Asset.
        Transfers can only be initiated from Accounts of `isolation` `POOLED`.

        Two Transactions are created in the course of processing a Transfer:
        one Transaction of type TRANSFER_OUTGOING in the sender Account,
        and a corresponding Transaction of type TRANSFER_INCOMING in the receiver Account.
        The second, Transfer (Incoming) Transaction, is only created if and when the
        first one, Transfer (Outgoing), is successfully completed.

        The required `reference` attribute serves as idempotency key, and MUST be unique
        across all Transactions initiated by the partner.

        If a request is issued twice with the same attributes,
        including the value of the `reference` attribute, the second response will be the same
        as the first one, and only one Transfer Transaction will be created as the effect.

        In the request to issue a Transfer either the `amount` or the `total_amount`
        MUST be specified. If the `amount` is specified, it indicates the "transacted amount",
        i.e. the exact amount that will be sent to the recipient Account.
        If the `total_amount` is specified, it indicates the amount that will be deducted from
        the Account Balance, the amount that will be sent to the recipient
        is determined after the fees are calculated and applied. Specifying the `total_amount`
        is useful in case it is desired to transfer the whole Balance of the Account.

        The successful response of the Transfer request contains a reference to a Transaction,
        which will *eventually* be created. If right after the partner tries to get this single
        Transaction by its ID and receives a `"404 Not found"` response, it is advised to
        repeat the attempt after some (rather short) period of time.
